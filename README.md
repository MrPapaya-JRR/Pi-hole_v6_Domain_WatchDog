# Pi-hole_v6_Domain_WatchDog
Pi-hole v6 Domain WatchDog is a Windows tool for Pi-hole v6 that watches your clipboard &amp; dragged links for URLs, extracts the domains, and lets you send them to your Pi-hole block list in batches with simple yes/no prompts.   Instead of copying &amp; pasting domains into the Pi-hole web interface one at a time, you can collect them as you browse.
